# Credit Karma Clone

A simple clone of Credit Karma's landing page built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an example endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.js`.

The `api` folder is where you can write all your backend code seamlessly with your frontend code.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

You can manually install the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) library by following the [official Tailwind guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

If you are using the [`create-next-app`](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/installation) script, the CLI will ask if you want to use Tailwind CSS and automatically install the library for you during the creation of your new Next.js project.

`create-next-app` will also automatically configure your template paths and add the Tailwind directives to your `global.css` file.

Happy styling with Tailwind CSS!
